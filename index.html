            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Anna Akhmatova's Life</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1889</strong> - Born in Bolshoy Fontan, newar Odessa, Ukraine</li>
              <li><strong>1910</strong> - at 21 joined a group of St. Petersburg poets, the Acmeists, whose leader, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nikolay-Stepanovich-Gumilyov"
                target="_blank">Nikolay Gumilyov</a>, she married in the same year and divorced in 1918.
              </li>
              <li><strong>1912-1914</strong> Her first collections, Vecher (1912; “Evening”) and Chyotki (1914; “Rosary”), especially the latter, brought her fame and made her poetic voice emblematic of the experience of her generation.</li>
              <li><strong>During World War I</strong> nd following the Revolution of 1917, she added to her main theme some civic, patriotic, and religious motifs but did not sacrifice her personal intensity or artistic conscience.</li>
              <li><strong>1920</strong> Communist cultural watchdogs proclaimed her “bourgeois and aristocratic” and condemned her poetry for its narrow preoccupation with love and God, even as her standing as a premier poetic voice of the generation was being affirmed by major critical authorities.  The execution of her former husband, Gumilyov, in 1921  on trumped-up charges of participation in an anti-Soviet conspiracy (the Tagantsev affair) further complicated her position. </li>
              <li><strong>1923</strong> She entered a period of almost complete poetic silence and literary ostracism, and no volume of her poetry appeared in the Soviet Union until 1940.</li>
              <li><strong>1935-1940</strong>Composed Rekviem (“Requiem”), occasioned by Akhmatova’s grief over the earlier arrest and imprisonment of her son in 1938. This masterpiece—a poetic monument to the sufferings of the Soviet people during Stalin’s terror—was published in Russia for the first time in 1989.
              <li><strong>1941</strong> Following the German invasion, Akhmatova was permitted to deliver an inspiring radio address to the women of Leningrad (St. Petersburg).</li>
              <li><strong>1946</strong> Harshly denounced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party for her “eroticism, mysticism, and political indifference.” Her poetry was castigated as “alien to the Soviet people” </li>
              <li><strong>1958</strong> Following Stalin's death, Akhmatova was slowly and ambivalently rehabilitated, and a slender volume of her poetry, including some of her translations, was published. </li>
              <li><strong>1940-1962</strong>Akhmatova’s longest work and perhaps her masterpiece, Poema bez geroya (“Poem Without a Hero”) was composed but not published in the Soviet Union until 1976.              </li>
              <li><strong>1964</strong> awarded the Etna-Taormina prize, an international poetry prize awarded in Italy, and in 1965 she received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Oxford. </li>
              <li><strong>1966</strong> Died in Moscow, Russia</li>
              <li><strong>1990</strong> The Complete Poems of Anna Akhmatova, also in two volumes, appeared in 1990 and was updated and expanded in 1992.</li>
            </ul>
